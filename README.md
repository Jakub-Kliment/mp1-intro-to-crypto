# About project
Introduction to cryptography and programming in Java. 
The goal of this project was to enhance our programming skills and apply 
the knowledge we learned in the first half of the first semester.

# Crypto
We explored multiple crypto systems such as Caesar's, Vigenere's, CBC, XOR and OneTimePad.
For all of these methodes we coded both the encryption and decryprion to better understand their functioning.

# Stegano
We worked with steganography as well in both the text and image versions.

# Utils 
We created couple of utility methodes to help with the encryption and decryption. 
These methodes were divided into categories such as working with bits, images and text.
